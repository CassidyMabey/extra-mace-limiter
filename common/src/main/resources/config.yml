# ADDITIONAL BLOCKED ITEMS
# =============================================================================
# Add other items that should be restricted like maces
# You can specify items by material type only, or by material type + custom model data
# Items must use exact Minecraft material names (e.g., DRAGON_EGG, NETHERITE_SWORD)

additional-blocked-items:
  # Simple material-based blocking (blocks all items of this type)
  items:
    # Examples (all disabled by default):
    # - DRAGON_EGG        # Prevent all dragon eggs from being stored
    # - NETHERITE_SWORD   # Block all netherite swords
    # - BEACON           # Block all beacon storage
    # - NETHER_STAR      # Prevent all nether star storage
  
  # Custom model data blocking (blocks specific items with custom model data)
  custom-model-data:
    # Examples (all disabled by default):
    # DIAMOND_SWORD:      # Block diamond swords with these custom model data values
    #   - 12345
    #   - 67890
    # GOLDEN_APPLE:       # Block golden apples with this custom model data
    #   - 99999
    # 
    # Format: MATERIAL_NAME: [list of custom model data numbers]
    # This allows blocking specific textured/custom items while allowing normal ones
